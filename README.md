# react-project-10
A Full-stack React application with Next.js + page routing (not app routing)

Visit: https://react-project-10-calculus0129s-projects.vercel.app/ . Have Fun!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

"What things you need to install the software and how to install them"

- git
- editor (e.g. vscode)

<!-- ```
Give examples
``` -->

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be.

#### 1. Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calculus0129/react-project-10.git
cd react-project-10
```

#### 2. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

<!-- [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/new-meetup](http://localhost:3000/api/new-meetup). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/new-meetup/index.js`. -->

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

<!-- This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel. -->

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Building

npm run build
```
